DEFOBJECT

defobject is an attempt at wrapping DEFCLASS such that it will - to
the unaided and not terribly caring eye - look like DEFSTRUCT.

Oddly, DEFOBJECT came into being before I knew about DEFSTRUCT, being
a Common Lisp tyro, yet it began to look like a DEFSTRUCT mimic. Well,
I suppose that shows some sort of dull wit upon my part, and I
determined to keep on with it, now intentionally conforming to the
similarities.


It kind of has a sister project - DEFCLASS*. DEFCLASS* does not
attempt to do the mimicry. DEFCLASS-STAR does not appear to reliably
exist any more online.
